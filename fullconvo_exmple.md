##only so u can see how the discussion around you began

I am thinking about a demo. I am thinking about using vibe coding tools to create a clone of the barclay web app and have only the home page scrollable and look real and at the bottom of the screen there will be an agent that if you click will pop up a screen. This agent is meant to be the demo. I am thinking that we can hardcode a system/ai prompt into claude code (ai ide) that would then essentially allow the users to interact with the bot. ask the bot a question about "how do i save up for a house?". and then we cna see it show that the bot/agent thinks and then makes a comment that is naturally written/sounds like a good comofrting, arespectful comment where it like asks a question (showing that it understands her situation and that it shows it processing data about her to make suggestions), and then the user responds something, then the ai will respond something and then it pops up a litte pop up/thing where it has a 5 step plan outlined (in nice ui/ux) that sound helpful, legitmate, and show case the experience and the gamification, and then user can click yes, and then it pops up on the home dashboard. 

something like that. any suggestions on the experience. because i want to then think , in plain english easy to understand clear terms, how this would work. i want to vibe code somethign easy beautiful and elegant. but i am wondering if we would allow the user to actually make an api call and then actually say something to the agent and then teh agent kinda interacts with it? and then we have it like have a prebuilt fact list or osmething that it will use or know how to respond? like do you ese what im saying. lets think hard so we cna just truly think and identify how and where we can optimize and create a really good, nice, egnaging experience. lets think hard!

You said:

Okay, so not bad. I actually do like some of the things that you're saying. What I thought was a little random is that you said that Buddy gives education advice, not formal financial advice. Yeah, shouldn't it? Isn't that the whole point of being the agentic system for Barclays? That it has that kind of power? Come on, hello? Um, but what I want to actually talk to you about is the information that I'm giving you below. So, I was talking with Copilot, and it begins middle of the conversation with the top prompt that I gave it, and I was responding to it how I was making some suggestions that I wanted it to be a static demo. So, a demo in the sense that we'll probably open it up to audience members to be able to scan their QR code over the phone, and they will be able to click the same buttons here as what the demo is, so they can do it themselves. But it should showcase that it's being warm, sounding natural, and that it's making suggestions. I wanted it to show similar to how you did, and I really like that you made it feel more natural. Nice. And I like kind of how you were going for it, but I like the way that it feels a little bit more intentional, maybe not as natural. So, I want us to fix, I also just wanted to make it, you know, seem that like the opportunity there for cross-style is like genuinely like super easy. And so, I'm giving this to you because I want you to read it, and, you know, if we're going to think that there's some areas where we can maybe just like think a little bit more and outline what should be done. And so, all this is like kind of like hard-coded again, and we want to just evaluate it, because what our output is going to be after you think hard, review this, is to do a complete breakdown and prompt description for clod code in our AI IDE to essentially create this. So, you're going to need to write a prompt, a system prompt for our AI IDE clod code that will need to explain and break down all of the context and all of the steps that we're going to need to take in order to create this demo. So, you're going to really need to think and encapsulate everything. You're going to need to describe how the interface is going to look. You need to describe how the UI and the UX will work and look. You need to enforce that it needs to be very clean, very modern, very Barclays. I need you to describe every single detail of what happens when you click the buddy button, what the messages look like, how they feel, the interaction, the speed, the design, the plan, the user experience of that, like evaluating that, the look and the feel, the niceness, how it feels good to sign up for that. And then thinking of maybe a little flow, right? We need to make sure we can keep this under, we can keep this around 20, 30 seconds max. And so, let's just be really diligent and make sure that you cover and you convey every piece of context because the AI won't be able to actually code it perfectly, you know?

I want you to make sure you can make this prompt flawless. i need you to think hard. I want you to espeiclaly sure that CLAUDE CODE does research into the design and finds images and can make sure that it perfectly mimic the look and feel of the barclays app. it should make sure that the other home page components look like it has the information of bella as relevant (we can fill in details as needed right, not that serious need to make it work). so lets really think about the entire design experience so we can ensure that this looks and feels real. goal is to be able to write such a good prompt that claude code will be able to perfectly execute this code flawlessly and will make this a world class demo.


*****

so i want us to think more about the way that "buddi" will sound. so remeber, we want the ai bot (buddi) to feel warm and friendly. something that maybe starts with a nice greeting :) when it pops up. and then the user (bella) asks a question, buddi responds naturally and shows understanding of bella (connecting relevant facts showing thinking from across different aspects of the app that we have bella with or on, as a way to subtly and importantly show case how the agent is working), and then it responds, then bella asks another question, then buddy does anohter think then it processess and proposes that plan for bella and then the plan is interesting because it is simple, smooth, modern and it should showcase within its plans actions that connect directly to the different segments or showcase how this is a direct revenue driver (by showcasing an opportunity/step that fits across checkings, savings, investment, retirement,) right you get what i see, ebcause then after the uesr says yes, the user clicks on each step and then it shows the action and then user can press yes or something to each of them quickly and then its like wow they did that action, and then ill take over and present and then show the % amt the company just made for each eys and check. does that make sense? i brain dumped so lets filter for quality and ideas. think hard. youre a genius. i need you to be objective and understand how we can get to the point

Planning detailed deliverables

Refining interactive plan
Love the direction. Let’s turn your brain‑dump into a crisp, demo‑ready design for Buddi—voice, dialogue, plan mechanics, UI micro‑interactions, and an internal “presenter view” that shows revenue levers lighting up as steps are accepted.

1) Buddi’s Voice & Behaviors (micro‑style guide)
Tone pillars

Warm & respectful: calm, encouraging, never pushy.
Clear & simple: short sentences, no jargon.
Competent & proactive: connects dots across the customer’s data, proposes next steps.
Consent‑first: explains what it uses and asks before taking action.
Language patterns

Greet + affirm + context + question.
Use you‑focused phrasing (“you’ll”, “your plan”).
One idea per sentence; max 2–3 sentences per bubble.
Offer 2 quick‑reply chips to guide flow.
Do / Don’t

Do: reflect back a fact (“You’ve saved $8,000”).
Don’t: guess income or make absolute promises.
Do: provide optionality (“Prefer a slower/safer track?”).
Don’t: hard‑sell products.
2) Multi‑turn demo script (Bella → Home goal)
Context known to Buddi: Bella (24), $8,000 in savings, wedding fund target $40k in 4 years, house in ~12 years, wants simple & motivating, lower risk.

Turn 0 — Pop & greet
Buddi:
“Hi Bella! I’m Buddi 👋 Ready when you are. What money goal can I help with today?”

(Quick‑replies: “Save for a house”, “Invest my savings”, “Stay motivated”)

Turn 1 — Ask
Bella: “How do I save up for a house?”

Buddi (shows it “knows” her):
“Great goal. I can see you’ve already saved $8,000. You’re also building a $40k wedding fund for 4 years out.
Want me to balance wedding + home, or prioritize the home?”

(Quick‑replies: Balance, Prioritize home)

Turn 2 — Clarify & prime plan
Bella: “Balance.”

Buddi:
“Got it. I’ll keep the wedding on track while moving your home fund forward.
Okay if I use your spend patterns and recent balances to size a plan?”

(CTA chip: Yes, use my data / “Not now”)

Turn 3 — Acknowledge consent & propose plan
Bella: “Yes, use my data.”

Buddi:
“Thanks. Here’s a simple 5‑step Home Plan that fits your budget and keeps risk low.”

5‑Step Plan (cards with toggles)

Open ‘Home Fund’ Savings (high‑yield, goal‑based) → Auto‑save right after each paycheck.
Round‑Ups: send spare change from card purchases to Home Fund (you can cap it).
Wedding vs Home Split: auto‑allocate X% → Wedding, Y% → Home (adjust anytime).
Starter Investment Sleeve (low‑cost, diversified) for longer‑term home horizon (small monthly) with guardrails.
Pension Nudges: +1% annual auto‑increase (you can pause)—keeps retirement on track while you save.
(Buttons: Review & Start | “Edit steps”)

Turn 4 — Micro‑interactions per step
When Bella taps Review & Start, open a stepper with 5 concise screens:

Home Fund

Pre‑filled name, icon, emoji.
Toggle Auto‑save (default on), suggested amount (editable).
Subtext: “You can pause anytime.”
Round‑Ups

Choose 10¢ / 25¢ / $1 round‑ups; optional weekly cap.
“See your projections” mini‑sparkline.
Split

Slider: Wedding X% / Home Y% with suggested default from her cash flow.
Investment Sleeve

“Smart Starter” portfolio (explain simply: diversified, low‑fee; small $/month).
Suitability note + “Talk to a human advisor” link.
Pension Nudge

Toggle +1% next pay raise; “You can pause.”
Buddi (after completion):
“Nice work, Bella! 🎉 Your Home Plan is live. I’ll cheer you on and alert you at each milestone.”

Dashboard pin appears: progress ring, next milestone, points earned, and a ‘View Rewards’ link.

3) How each step showcases agentic value and revenue levers
Plan Step	What the user sees	What the presenter can say (internal lens)
1. Home Fund (auto‑save)	A new goal account + auto‑transfer	Deposits↑ → NII. Immediate product engagement.
2. Round‑Ups	Micro‑savings from card spend	Card usage↑ → interchange; deposits↑ from round‑ups.
3. Wedding/Home split	Transparent allocation	Stickiness/retention↑; reduces leakage to other banks.
4. Starter Investment Sleeve	Low‑cost recurring contribution	AUM↑ → advisory/platform fees; cross‑sell into investing.
5. Pension nudge	Auto +1% per year	Retirement balances↑; long‑term relationship value.
Rewards (overlay)	Points & perks	Affiliate/partner fees, referrals, higher engagement.
Presenter tip: build a toggleable “Revenue HUD” (only on your device) that briefly overlays each accepted step with a small tag (e.g., “NII lever”, “Interchange lever”, “AUM lever”, “Affiliate”). Keep it subtle—1.5 seconds, top‑right.

4) UX details that make it feel premium (but simple)
Typing ellipsis and 1–2s delay before thoughtful messages—signals “thinking” without making users wait.
Two chips per turn to keep flow on rails while allowing free text.
Progress ring on the dashboard card; confetti micro‑burst only once to keep it classy.
“Why this step?” mini‑drawer on each card (30 words max); builds trust, avoids jargon.
Undo/ pause affordances next to every automation—empowerment reduces abandonment.
Milestones every $500 (or user‑picked), each tied to small perks (e.g., partner coffee/voucher); keeps dopamine loop tasteful.
